TODO: tpr=0.5 -> fpr as a metric
    - Should there be a choice between this and auc, or should I try to combine them.
    - Actually, why not F-score? It seems to make more sense, as it looks at tpr=0.5, but also looks at fpr, tnr, fnr.

TODO: Momentum as a parameter (READ: how they behave/conserve in keras with one-by-one epoch calls)
    - Notes:
        - keras fit function provides a start_epoch keyword, which helps with taking care of optimizer.
    - Not using, one-by-one epoch calls anymore, due to learning decay as parameter.
    - Since, different opt algorithms have different key-words for momentum (ex. beta_1, beta_2, momentum),
    how should I handle it?
        - That would require totally new dict for these parameters.
    - maybe get_config() -> from config().
    - Need to read more about how Optimizers work in keras, but they basically keep their config throughout the epochs
        - Maybe there's a field which keeps epoch count.

22/06: Learning decay as a parameter:
    - Used Learning rate scheduler: still needs to change some it in __mutate in __Mutator.

TODO: Check the size of the training dataset: https://github.com/36000/cnn_colorflow/blob/master/lcurve.py
    - Need to clone from John
    - 25/08 - Cloned, and tried to run it. Got to talk with John, about file, because cannot really understand it.

22/06: Create log file support, instead of printing to console:
    - Done, prints to do bottom of the file.

22/06: No Two max_outs/dropouts in a row:
    - Done, however without possibility of different configs (ex. always two convs in a row, before maxout).

05/07: Use weights of the old network, while creating a new one.
    - 23/06 - add layer - Testing how different layers behave.
    - 28/06 - add layer - First approach, by creating three models, and then merging them.
    - 29/06 - add layer - Deleted first approach.
                            New Approach:
                                1. Create a new model.
                                2. Populate it with copies of old model.
                                3. Set weights to ones from last model + new weights for a new layer.
    - 01/07 - rmv layer - Added a function to remove a layer. Fails, if the layer is first one, or last one.
                            That's not the case in this research though. (First layer is always Activation,
                            last one is Dense w/ 2 neurons).
    - 02/07 - add layer - Implemented into mutating.
                            Fixed a bug when a Conv layer is added right before MaxOut before Flatten.
                            Easy fix though, can be done more efficiently when copying weights.
    - 03/07 - bth fn's  - Implemented remove into mutating.
                            Changed __init__ of network, so that it's easier to make new mutation combinations.
                            Made a function to find a weight index of first Dense layer.
    - 04/07 - bth fn's  - Implemented a function to copy weights from a middle of next dense layer.
    - 05/07 - bth fn's  - Fixed minor bugs, which resulted in incorrect shape.

02-05/07: Make it Maxout safe, when adding new layer. AKA implement limit so that maxpool cannot be added if previous/next layer is maxpool:
    - Fixed during problem above.

04-06/07: Bug. Sometimes training pops out NaNs. Understand why, fix. It's not optimizer, unless there's something wrong with SGD/lr combination.
    Nets:
        1:
            architecture: [((3, 3), 8), 128, 64]
            optimizer   : Adam
            activation  : relu
            callbacks   : EarlyStopping/default
        2:
            architecture: [((7, 7), 16), ((5, 5), 8), 'max', 32, 32, 'drop0.30']
            optimizer   : Adam
            activation  : relu
            callbacks   : EarlyStopping/default
        3:
            architecture: [((5, 5), 8), 'max', ((5, 5), 8), 'max', 64, 'drop0.30']
            optimizer   : Adam
            activation  : relu
            callbacks   : EarlyStopping/default
    Solved.

    Note for future:
        Basically using relu with cross_entropy doesn't work, since 0 is not in domain of cross_entropy, but in range of relu.
        Thus, even though the last activation was tanh, the problem was 0, appearing sometimes in the range of nn(since 0 -> 0 in tanh).
        Use SIGMOID as activation in last layer of nn, whenever possible.

17/07-07/09: Bug. Nan in loss. Now in middle of the epoch. Maybe something with divergent optimizer.
    Nets:
        1 (17/07):
            architecture: [((3, 3), 16), 64, 64, 'drop0.70']
            optimizer   : Nadam, 0.001
            activation  : relu
            callbacks   : EarlyStopping/default
        2 (26/08):
            architecture: [((5, 5), 16), ((5, 5), 16), ((5, 5), 16), 'max', ((5, 5), 16), 64, 'drop0.70', 64, 'drop0.70', 64]
            optimizer   : Nadam, 0.001
            activation  : relu
            callbacks   : EarlyStopping/default
    - As of 22/08 it never happened after around 1/08, which hints that it is an extremely rare bug,
        and may be connected to something that I already fixed on a way, or some bug in keras.
    - 26/08 - Seems that it is not something with Nadam, with lr 0.001, but in need of investigation that.
            - Not related to input data, as exactly same data sometimes results in nans, and sometimes does not
            - Thus, it is probably, how weights are initialized.
    - 06/09 - Run a NaN investigation program on all configurations in normal program. Since no pattern is found,
                it would be better to implement quick fix, which after each epoch (batch?) would check if loss is NaN, and then, if so,
                it would return weights to ones before epoch, and stop learning.
    - 07/09 - Quick fix applied. It's called NaN looker, and if there is NaN in loss, the weights return to value before the epoch began.
                A deeper study in what is the problem would be nice to do. Also try None values for lr.
    - TODO: Upload NaN on github and make a stack exchange/keras github issue on it.

17/07: Investigate why dropout at the end of arch is legal. It's shouldn't be.
    - Done, added 'or j == len(architecture) - 1' in __init__ of network. Also added a test, in the test_network.

17/07: Make probability distributions for different choices in __mutate.
    - Done. Used numpy.random instead of random.

25/09: Limit depth/number of weights. Include a strict weight # cap.
    - Old:
        - 21/07 - Made a function to determine # of weights in the model.
        - 22/07 - Implemented in add_layer method. However, it doesn't have strict weight # cap. (Only a loose one, before adding a new layer)
        - 24/07 - Added a max depth requirement when generating a networks for first time.
    - 25/09 - Due to many changes in the code, depth limit is not working, and weight cap may not even be possible.
                2. Done limits, on the level of Network.mutate... They are not as strict as the possibly can,
                    however it somewhat works, and takes at most a generation (or 2 in edge case) to get back to within the bounds.

TODO: Make number of conv_max, and dense_drop sequences similar, when creating the net and in evolution.
    - 25/09 - Done for network creation. For evolution tweaking the numbers is required

23/07: To prevent overfitting. Save weights before training, then compare scores after fitting. If it's worse, keep the weights.
    - Done:
        1. Modified __init__ to add previous score and previous weights.
        2. Modified fit to update these variables.
        3. Modified score to determine which weights to keep based on score.

22-26/07: Split helper methods based on what they are helping with. Maybe even make a backend folder.
    - 22/07 - Methods to mutate have different .py file.
    - Migrated to a 'helpers' subdir.

24/07: Split local variables to 2 files. One for files, one for constants.
    - Done. Put in a subdir.

24-25/07: Make comments for all the functions/methods
    - 24/07 - commented all of network functions.
    - 25/07 - comments on all of mutator, helpers_mutate functions.
    - 14/08 - comments on all of helpers/get_file_names/log_save. However, added private helpers for helpers_mutate, which won't have comments.

17/08-10/09: Improve the two parent mutation, so that it is somewhat random.
    1. Instead of having random mutation, make a mutation depended on two parents, and make random choices based on them. Or combine it and use both (random and parents version).
        - 17-18/08 -    1. Implemented and tested. Works, however is purely deterministic,
                            which may be a problem with a specific net propagating through
                            generations and overtaking population, with no randomness at all.
                        2. Now supports only 2 parents, but should be relatively simple to generalize
                            it to n parents through diagonal multi-parent crossover
                            (section 2.3 of https://www.cs.vu.nl/~gusz/papers/PPSN1994-GAs-with-multiparent.pdf).
                        3. This adds only one hyper-parameter to this program,
                            which was meant to minimize # of choices by a human. So that's good.
                        4. Make use of weights from the model which gives the conv_max_seq, and ones after dense_drop
                            - 26/08 - Made for conv_max_seq
                            - 10/09 - Done in all cases. Look at 'When copying over conv-max seq, make sure that...' TO-DO.
    2. Created a second, much more random version of a parent mutation, however copying weights cannot be supported.
        - 26/08 - 1. Only sequences are copied, not whole halves of networks.
    - generalize it to n parent mutation?
    - can it be deterministic, or still somewhat random?


30/07-01/08: Add a sequence of conv_max, instead of adding one layer at a time.
    - 30/07 - Basic function is written. Throws an error with copying over weights.
    - 31/07 - 1. Fixed an error. Not yet implemented.
              2. Added a mirror function of adding a dense layer, followed by a dropout.
                    // Note: Even if it will be added at the end, dropout will be dropped, due to Network __init__ restrictions.
              3. Added remove_conv_max function. Tested and working.
    - 01/08 - 1. Added remove_dense_drop function. Tested and working.

30/07: BUG. Cross-references are not working. in B: import A, in A: import B.
    - Done with helpers_mutate and Network.

14/08: Remake the code for helpers/mutator/network, so that non-random injections are supported.
    - 14/08 - 1. Done for helpers_mutate. Checked Network, not needed.
              2. Done for creating new Networks in Mutator.
    - It can help debug the Nan in loss bug, which is extremely hard to reproduce (2-6h for single reproduction)
    - Still need an idea on what to do with series of mutations (which ones are done), since they're random right now.
        - That is not needed however, since one can easily do it by just calling series of functions

16-17/08: BUG!! When making a copy_model in Network, still check for a dropout as a second to last layer, and if needed, remove.
    - Done, created a wrap around method in helpers for cloning the model. Also added a constraint for 2 dropout in a row.

17/08: When making a copy_model in Network, still check for a 2 maxpools in a row, and if needed, remove (CHANGE OF WEIGHTS SHAPE!!!).
    - Done. Slightly modified bug above, and added support for maxpools, not only dropouts.

16-17/08: BUG. Edge case with __insert_layer, with dropouts and dense layers being inserted at the end. Made an error with assert model and arch match.

17/08: Updated test file, to make it easier to add new tests. Also added all tests for private mutation methods.

22/08: Implement sequences in creating new network.
    - Done, because of the beginning, each network starts with one random conv layer and one random dense layer.

28/08: Make 2/3 modes of data loading:
    - Done. If n_layers set to 0, then prepare data will just set whole dataset as x,y.

26/08-10/09: When copying over conv-max seq, make sure that the weights of the seqs, are kept. In _parent_mutation.
    - 26/08 - Done in parent mutation 1.
    - 10/09 - Done for parent mutation 2. In Conv-Max kernel is kept, since the everything else is different.
                In Dense-Drop, bias is kept, and maximum # of weights possible is copied (Since, it's number depends on shape of input, they do not always match exactly).

25-26/08: Make a smart limit for number of maxpools.
    - Made 2 properties, one for # of dimensions of input, one for maximal number of maxpool layers.
    - Implemented.

01-17/09: Make a support for 1-D input too. (by making flag inp_dim?) In order to add support for 1-D input prepare_data has to be modified.
    - 01/09 - Implemented shape of input variable.
    - 17/09 - Done some stuff. So nets can be trained, but fail on first evolution between first and second gen.
    - 25/09 - Looks like it works.

02/09: Limit number of things printed under debug (make a third mode of debugging? or move some things into deep_debug)
    - Done.

01-02/09: Speed up Network creation (basically base it only on arch in mutator, and then make a Network out of it).
    - 01/09 - Done, created add sequences based only on arch.
    - 02/09 - Implemented in creating new networks.

10-14/09: Reorganize code in different branch. Specifically mutator.
    - 10/09 - Branched out arch-opt-reorganize, and started migrating methods as described in commits.
    - 14/09 - Merge back to master. However, still need to implement function which can change train data each generation.
                Also, there's a rare bug in the mutate_parent_2 with copying weights over sometimes.
    - 14/09 - Part 2, Function which changes data over time is specified.

22/09: README, and migrate to a different repo than main ColorFlow.
    - Done, needs to be updated, especially with package requirements

TODO: Look for all github repos I was basing the code on.

18/09: Bug in parent_mutation_2 with copying over weights. (Look at To-Do in Network)
    - Nets:
         1. Net 1: [((3, 3), 8), ((3, 3), 8), ((3, 3), 8), 'max', ((3, 3), 8), ((3, 3), 8), ((3, 3), 8), 'max', 128, 64]
         2. Net 2: [((3, 3), 8), 64, 128, 'drop0.30', 32, 'drop0.70', 16, 'drop0.50', 64]
    - Done

23/09: Some recursion problem, remove_conv_max, and add_conv_max get looped.
    - Done, problem with wrong limit of max (channels last in shape of data, instead of first, as in implementation)

22-25/09: Transforming code to be compatible with python2, fixing bugs, so it's able to run on squirrel.

23/09: Github issue: https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/11212. For now created a get_l_p23_offset func in program_params for it
    - Done, problem was in outdated keras on squirrel.

TODO: Learning rate sometimes blows up and is negative
    - 25/09 - Seems like a an issue, which a lot of ppl have, since there's a lot of issues on keras' github.
                One idea (another quick fix) is to keep track of it in the NaNSafer, which on epoch start could look at the opt's lr, and reset it to default if negative.

25/09: Make mode to save all networks, after each generation
    - Done, flag in evolve is save_all_nets

TODO: Make add_conv_max/dense_drop faster, by not for-looping but cloning weights once, and rebuilding the net once.
